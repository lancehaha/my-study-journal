# Execution Plan: Learning Notes Blog Platform

## 1. Application Use Cases
### Background and Motivation:
Finding quality resources related to current
academic courses among numerous online courses can be challenging. This
project, inspired by and modified from a video teaching project, aims to create
a learning notes blog platform focused on integrating and recommending
online learning resources closely related to school courses.
### Key Features:
#### Course Resource Listing:
Lists the courses currently being studied in the
grade, allowing users to share links and introductions to quality online
courses related to these subjects.
### Social Interaction: 
Users can like or dislike courses, with the platform
sorting based on the number of likes. Integrated Video Playback: Incorporates quality learning videos to allow
direct playback on the site without redirecting to other websites. Comments and Discussion: Users can comment and discuss video content, fostering a learning community atmosphere.
### Resource Recommendation Sorting: 
Sorts learning resources based on
likes and comment activity, helping users quickly find high-quality study
materials. 
## 2. Backend Implementation Choice

Technology Choice: Opting to use Go language for backend development to
leverage its high performance and concurrent processing capabilities.
### Current Status and Plan:
The project is initially based on a video teaching project, but all code is
independently written. Currently, the backend user management function is not fully developed, with
some features simulated on the frontend; plans are in place for future
enhancement. Will implement secure user authentication, database interaction, and video
playback integration.
## 3. Additional Plans and Notes

Frontend Design: Utilizing modern frontend frameworks to design an
intuitive, responsive interface. User Experience: Focusing on simple and intuitive user operation
processes. 
### Testing and Debugging:
Comprehensive testing planned to ensure
application stability. Future Development: Considering introducing a course recommendation
algorithm for automated related resource suggestions.
### Project Origin and Coding Process:
The project is a modification and expansion based on a video teaching project. Although the project originated from teaching content, all code is personally
and independently written. During the coding process, Google and ChatGPT were used as tools to assist in
looking up function usage, without heavily relying on ChatGPT.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
